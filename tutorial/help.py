Sometimes people hit roadblocks when using Streamlit. Here are a few problems we have seen, and ways we have solved them in the past. Hopefully, you find a fix that works for you. If not, please let us know (<hello@streamlit.io>).

### Opening the Streamlit report in my browser doesn't work

You ran `streamlit help` or `python my_script.py` and it printed out the URL
where you should find your report - but it doesn't seem to work when you open
that link!

**If you are running Streamlit remotely**, this can happen if you haven't
opened up port 8501 on your instance.

How do you fix this? First, click on your instance in the [AWS
Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#Instances:sort=instanceId).
Then scroll down until you see the "Security Groups" & click on that. Click on
"Inbound" & "Edit". Next, add a "Custom TCP" rule that allows the Port Range
"8501" with Source "0.0.0.0/0".

### Streamlit just hangs when I run my script

Sometimes there is a hanging proxy from your previous run. A quick way to fix
that is by running this command:

```bash
$ streamlit kill_proxy
```
